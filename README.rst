Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------

mksapkg setup
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For simple script based apps (like most of the current packages), you only need mksapkg to create a binary.

On Ubuntu 16.04:

    apt-get install libxml2:i386
    
Ensure you have openssl v1.0.x, not openssl v1.1+.

Native apps
^^^^^^^^^^^

If you want to compile native apps, you'll need a complete wdpksrc / spksrc toolchain. Then follow the 

Currently, these custom WD targets are available in this `SynoCommunity fork`_

* wdx64 - WD PR2100/PR4100/DL2100/DL4100
* wdpro - WD PR2100 / PR4100 with 4.1.9 kernel
* wddl - WD DL2100 / DL4100 with 3.10.28 kernel
* wdarm - all other devices (firmware version 2.x only!)

Usage
-----
Once you have a development environment set up , you can start building packages, create new ones, or improve upon existing packages while making your changes available to other people.
See the `Developers HOW TO`_ for information on how to use spksrc.

Note that spksrc creates synology SPK packages. 

* rename the .spk package with the .tar extension
* unpack with `tar xf somepackage.tar`
* move the bins and libs to your wdpk somepackage
* modify the start/stop scripts as necessary into the wdpk format, stripped from all synology specific logics.
