wdpksrc
=======
wdpksrc is a cross compilation framework intended to compile and package software for Western Digital NAS devices. Packages are made available via the `WDCommunity repository`_. This is a fork of `SynoCommunity`_.

WDCommunity provides packages for Western Digital-branded NAS devices.
Packages are provided for free and made by developers on their free time. See how you can contribute.

Many packages are published on the WD `community forum`_.

Contributing

Before opening a new issue, check the `FAQ`_ and search open issues.
If you can't find an answer, or if you want to open a package request, read `CONTRIBUTING`_ to make sure you include all the information needed for contributors to handle your request.


Setup Development Environment
-----------------------------

On Ubuntu 16.04:

    apt-get update
    apt-get install libxml2:i386

Docker
^^^^^^
* Fork and clone wdpksrc: ``git clone https://You@github.com/You/wdpksrc.git ~/wdpksrc``
* Install Docker on your host OS: `Docker installation`_. A wget-based alternative for linux: `Install Docker with wget`_.
* Download the wdpksrc docker container: ``docker pull wdcommunity/wdpksrc``
* Run the container with ``docker run -it -v ~/wdpksrc:/wdpksrc wdcommunity/wdpksrc /bin/bash``


Virtual machine
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A virtual machine based on an 64-bit version of Debian stable OS is recommended. Non-x86 architectures are not supported.

* Install the requirements::

    sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386 && sudo apt-get update
    sudo aptitude install build-essential debootstrap python-pip automake libgmp3-dev libltdl-dev libunistring-dev libffi-dev libcppunit-dev ncurses-dev imagemagick libssl-dev pkg-config zlib1g-dev gettext git curl subversion check intltool gperf flex bison xmlto php5 expect libgc-dev mercurial cython lzip cmake swig libc6-i386 libmount-dev libpcre3-dev libbz2-dev
    sudo pip install -U setuptools pip wheel httpie

* You may need to install some packages from testing like autoconf. Read about Apt-Pinning to know how to do that.
* Some older toolchains may require 32-bit development versions of packages, e.g. `zlib1g-dev:i386`


Usage
-----
Once you have a development environment set up, you can start building packages, create new ones, or improve upon existing packages while making your changes available to other people.
See the `Developers HOW TO`_ for information on how to use wdpksrc.
